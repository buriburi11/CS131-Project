# CS131-Project
Zero Waste Game ADA Compliance Project

Sprint 1:
    In this sprint, we added keyboard navigation to the matching game. Now players can use the arrow keys to move between tiles, and the selected tile is highlighted with a red border so it’s clear which one is focused. players can then press Enter or Space to flip the tile. we also edited some of the game’s pictures to fit the project design. And finally, We added a shortcut where players can press M to mute or unmute the background music.
