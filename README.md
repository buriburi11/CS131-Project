# CS131-Project
Zero Waste Game ADA Compliance Project

Sprint 1:
    In this sprint, we added keyboard navigation to the matching game. Now players can use the arrow keys to move between tiles, and the selected tile is highlighted with a red border so it’s clear which one is focused. players can then press Enter or Space to flip the tile. we also edited some of the game’s pictures to fit the project design. And finally, We added a shortcut where players can press M to mute or unmute the background music.

Sprint 2:
    In Sprint 2, we implemented full keyboard navigation for the sorting game. Players can now complete the entire game without using the mouse. At any given time, only one falling item is visible, and it is highlighted with a red border for clarity. Using the keys Z, X, C, and V, players can quickly sort items into their respective lanes. When an item is successfully placed into the correct bin, the next item appears automatically, and gameplay continues in this way until all items have been sorted.

Sprint 3:
    In Sprint 3, our main focus is improving accessibility and keyboard control for the game.
    We’ve added more keyboard functionality:
    Player can use the H key returns to the home screen,
    The R key restarts the game,
    and Left and Right arrow keys let players choose between Matching and Sorting games on the game selection screen.
    With these updates, the game is now fully playable using just the keyboard.
    However, as players, it’s not obvious that these controls exist — there’s no text instruction on-screen to guide them.
    So for Sprint 4, our goal is to design and implement an on-screen introduction that explains the keyboard controls, making the game more accessible for all players.
