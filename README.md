# CS131-Project
Zero Waste Game ADA Compliance Project

Sprint 1:
    In this sprint, we added keyboard navigation to the matching game. Now players can use the arrow keys to move between tiles, and the selected tile is highlighted with a red border so it’s clear which one is focused. players can then press Enter or Space to flip the tile. we also edited some of the game’s pictures to fit the project design. And finally, We added a shortcut where players can press M to mute or unmute the background music.

Sprint 2:
    In Sprint 2, we implemented full keyboard navigation for the sorting game. Players can now complete the entire game without using the mouse. At any given time, only one falling item is visible, and it is highlighted with a red border for clarity. Using the keys Z, X, C, and V, players can quickly sort items into their respective lanes. When an item is successfully placed into the correct bin, the next item appears automatically, and gameplay continues in this way until all items have been sorted.
    Additionally, we added the ESC key functionality to allow players to pause and unpause the game during gameplay. We also refactored the JavaScript code, moving it out of the HTML file into a separate JS file for better organization and maintainability.
    For our next sprint, we will mainly focus on implementing keyboard controls for level selection — this feature is already in progress. We also plan to add on-screen instructions to help players understand that the Z, X, C, and V keys can be used to control the falling items. Lastly, since the current game screen has a fixed size, we aim to make it adjustable so it can properly fit different screen resolutions or full-screen modes.
