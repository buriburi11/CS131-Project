# CS131-Project

Zero Waste Game ADA Compliance Project

Sprint 1:
In this sprint, we added keyboard navigation to the matching game. Now players can use the arrow keys to move between tiles, and the selected tile is highlighted with a red border so it’s clear which one is focused. players can then press Enter or Space to flip the tile. we also edited some of the game’s pictures to fit the project design. And finally, We added a shortcut where players can press M to mute or unmute the background music.

Sprint 2:
In Sprint 2, we implemented full keyboard navigation for the sorting game. Players can now complete the entire game without using the mouse. At any given time, only one falling item is visible, and it is highlighted with a red border for clarity. Using the keys Z, X, C, and V, players can quickly sort items into their respective lanes. When an item is successfully placed into the correct bin, the next item appears automatically, and gameplay continues in this way until all items have been sorted.

Sprint 3:
In Sprint 3, our main focus is improving accessibility and keyboard control for the game.
We’ve added more keyboard functionality:
Player can use the H key returns to the home screen,
The R key restarts the game,
Keys 1,2,3 for the level slection screen,
and Left and Right arrow keys let players choose between Matching and Sorting games on the game selection screen.
With these updates, the game is now fully playable using just the keyboard.
However, as players, it’s not obvious that these controls exist — there’s no text instruction on-screen to guide them.

Update: the level selection sprites have been updated for better instruction to the user, progress bar now correctly increments to 100% instead of 75%, pulse speed of all icons has been set to 25% across the board, and the queue system in the sorting game now only drops the next item if the current one is sorted along with a fairness mechanic on all of the bin-sorting buttons.
So for Sprint 4, our goal is to design and implement an on-screen introduction that explains the keyboard controls, making the game more accessible for all players.

For our next sprint, we’re planning to finish adding the on-screen instructions for all the keyboard controls, so players can easily see which keys they can use during the game.
We’ll also make the timer optional — players will be able to turn it off if they prefer a more relaxed experience.
Another improvement we’re planning is to make the game screen adjustable, so it can switch to full-screen mode. We might also add a toggle key to make it easier to turn on or off.
Lastly, we’ll add both a volume slider and a brightness slider, so players can customize their audio and visual experience.


Sprint 4:
Now, the game is fully playable using only the keyboard, so players don’t need a mouse at all.
We also added clear on-screen instructions to guide players through each game and show all the keyboard controls.
In addition, we implemented a volume slider so players can easily adjust the sound level while playing.
For our next sprint, we plan to make the game screen adjustable, so it can switch to full-screen mode. 
And we might also add a brightness slider to make the visuals more comfortable for players.
